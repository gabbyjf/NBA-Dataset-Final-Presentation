# NBA-Dataset-Work
You will find my NBA dataset tableau dashboard video that explains the visualizations I created and what can be said about them based on patterns and distribution of data. You will also find my final video presentation that details some of my key findings in my analyses. In my select of data for the National Basketball Association, I asked the research question: "Are NBA players' performance worthy of their salary?" By running models and creating easy-to-read visualizations, I was able to draw some conclusions and make some general observations soley based on the players' statistics that were included in this dataset.
